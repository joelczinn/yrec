Test Suite
==========

YREC includes an explicit set of namelists which cover behaviors known to work in the code. They act as example namelists for how to work with the code, and log specific configurations where the code will produce an expected result. As a result, they are also used to test backwards compatibility of the code between versions.

The test suite is currently divided into two categories: one is the **published test suite**, which represents a stable set of models published with one or more YREC instrument papers. The second is a set of contributed **test suite extras**, which demonstrate relevant code functionality and may be independently documented or published.

## Published Test Suite (`testsuite/`)

The stable, published, version of the test suite is located in the `testsuite/` directory, corresponding to the suite described in Pinsonneault et al. (*in prep*). This test suite covers a wide range in mass, evolutionary state, and input physics.

```{admonition} Defaults
:class: important
All tracks are solar metallicity unless otherwise noted. Standard suite includes the GS98 mixture and OP opacities, OPAL06 + SCV EoS, gray atmosphere, 0.2 Hp core overshoot w/0.15 beta above 1 Msun, SFII rates, no diffusion or rotation.
